# strategyOS API (Stub)

Planned endpoints:
- `GET /health` for uptime
- `POST /scenarios` to score or echo strategies
- `POST /playbooks/:id/export` to generate artifacts

Stack candidates: FastAPI, Remix Edge, or Cloudflare Workers. Authentication and persistence are to be defined once pilot partners confirm requirements.
