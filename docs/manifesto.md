# strategyOS Manifesto (Draft)

## Premise
Modern strategy work is messy: decks stuck in inboxes, analyses in notebooks, facilitation notes in chat threads. strategyOS provides a shared substrate so narrative, numbers, and ops live together.

## Principles
1. **Composable** – Treat every canvas, checklist, and model as a component.
2. **Observable** – Record assumptions and evidence for every key decision.
3. **Playable** – Encourage scenario rehearsals and fast iteration.
4. **Portable** – Export artifacts to PDFs, CLIs, or APIs.

## 2026 H1 Focus
- Define canonical scenario schema
- Ship facilitator tooling (timers, prompts, capture)
- Wire quantitative scoring hooks
- Publish starter libraries for policy, product, and civic playbooks

_Update this document as soon as we resolve scope, governance, or release cadence._
