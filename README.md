# strategyOS

strategyOS is a workspace for designing and stress-testing long-range strategies. The goal is to combine strategic narratives, quantitative models, and operating playbooks into one modular system that teams can fork or remix.

## Repository Layout

- `docs/` — concept notes, method primers, glossary
- `playbooks/` — decision frameworks and facilitation scripts
- `packages/analysis/` — reusable model + simulation code
- `services/api/` — interfaces for scoring scenarios or retrieving insights
- `infrastructure/` — deployment notes, notebooks, datasets

## Initial Milestones

1. Draft the core strategyOS manifesto
2. Capture a baseline scenario template (actors, assets, shocks, metrics)
3. Stand up a simple scoring API stub
4. Publish the first facilitation playbook (60-minute strategy lab)

Everything here is alpha; expect directories to hold stubs until we lock scope with stakeholders.
